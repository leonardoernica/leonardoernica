## 🌟 Personal Philosophy
> "Code is poetry when it solves real problems. The most elegant solutions are often the simplest ones that make people's lives better."

**Beyond Code:** When I'm not building Tuyuu, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or hiking in nature to recharge. I believe in building with purpose and creating technology that serves people, not the other way around.

**Fun Fact:** I once automated my entire morning routine with Python scripts - from coffee machine to news briefing!
