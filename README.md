# Hello, I'm Leo! üëã

## üöÄ About Me
I am a **Production Engineering** enthusiast with a passion for innovation. My interests and expertise span multiple domains:

- **Process Optimization & Automation**: Streamlining operations to enhance efficiency.
- **Planning & Agile Methodologies**: Implementing strategic planning and agile practices to drive project success.
- **Predictive Analysis & Data Manipulation**: Leveraging data to forecast trends and inform decisions.
- **Technology in Sales**: Applying tech solutions to revolutionize sales strategies and operations.

## üíª Technologies and Tools
My projects are powered by a variety of technologies and tools, each chosen for its unique ability to address specific challenges:

- **Python**: My go-to language for data analysis, machine learning, and back-end development. Its versatility and the vast ecosystem of libraries (such as Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow) enable me to tackle complex data manipulation and predictive modeling tasks efficiently.
- **JavaScript**: I leverage JavaScript for front-end development and to create interactive web applications. Utilizing frameworks such as React and Node.js, I build seamless user experiences and scalable back-end services.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: GCP's suite of cloud services is crucial for deploying and scaling applications, data storage, and analysis. Services like Compute Engine and Cloud Functions support my projects' infrastructure needs.
- **Apps Script**: This powerful scripting platform allows me to extend Google Apps and create custom functionality for Sheets, Docs, and Forms, automating workflows and enhancing productivity.
- **Google Sheets**: An invaluable tool for quick data analysis, prototyping, and automation. I often use it in conjunction with Apps Script to process data and manage projects.
- **Zapier**: For automation between web apps, Zapier is my go-to. It connects disparate services without the need for custom code, streamlining workflows and data transfer between my favorite tools.
- **PostgreSQL & MySQL**: These relational database management systems store, organize, and retrieve data for my applications. Their robustness and feature sets support complex queries and data relationships.
- **OpenAI API**: Integrating AI capabilities into applications, from natural language processing to generative tasks, leveraging the cutting-edge models provided by OpenAI.

These technologies form the backbone of my projects, enabling me to create optimized and innovative solutions.

Currently, I am focusing on a project aimed at **agile and humanized customer service via AI**, transforming the way companies interact with their clients through innovative and efficient experiences.
